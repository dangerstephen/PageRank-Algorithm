# PageRank-Algorithm
Mathematics of Google Search

## A little bit of history
In the early 90s the first search engines used *text based ranking systems*.

**Problem:** May be millions of pages on the web using the searching word, and containing thousands of those words but any of them may not be the one that used most often.

**Solution:**

**Larry Page** and **Sergey Brin**(Google founders) invented **Page Rank algorithm**, used by the **Google search engine**, while they were graduate students at Stanford.

##PageRank idea and Mathematics
**Idea:** Sort pages by their relevance.

**How to count relevance(page rank)?**<br />
**Rank** of the page depends on how many pages link to it and on those pages own **Rank** and **number of outgoing links**.

**Example:**<br/>

Let's represent the picture above using **directed graph:**<br />

Based on the graph we can compose a system of equations:<br />

Where **x1, x2, x3, x4** importance(rank) of each of the pages 1-4.<br />

Let's find **PageRank** vector using method for **dynamical systems**:<br />
To find it we have to find the last value of the vector in the sequence "**v, Av, A^2v..., A^kv**" before it becomes the equilibrium value.<br />
v - initial rank vector (Suppose that initially the importance is uniformly distributed among the 4 nodes, each getting Â¼)<br />
A - transition matrix of the system above =>

Based on gotten **PageRank vector** the search result would be:<br />
1. Page1
2. Page3
3. Page4
4. Page2
